search and build a  test paper by using GA Algorithm 

Based on GA algorithm, this program can quickly select some test questions from a large number of questions(stored in database) to form an approximately optimal test paper that meets the conditions (such as the overall difficulty coefficient of the test paper, the knowledge points covered by the test paper, etc.)
